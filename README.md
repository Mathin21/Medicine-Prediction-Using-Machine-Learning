# Medicine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

The use of machine learning algorithms has enabled the prediction and diagnosis of a wide spectrum of medical disorders. This study focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict common disorders like fever, cold, cough, diabetes, hypertension, muscle pain, earache, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dry cough, and toothache,etc. The objective is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist in the early identification and management of these diseases.To accomplish this, a dataset containing patient records, symptoms, and corresponding disease labels was collected. The different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, gaussianNB and logistic regression, were employed to train and evaluate predictive models. Feature selection techniques were utilized to identify the most important symptoms for disease prediction.Once the prediction of disease is done it should predict the medicine according to the disease and its symptoms. It is also very important that dosage for the particular medicine is done based on the age factor. Machine learning algorithms are applied to the dataset based on accuracy, selecting the best method from the comparison of the above mentioned algorithms.
